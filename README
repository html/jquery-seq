jQuery-seq is a set of functions to do some tasks sequentially.
It uses jQuery deferred object.
You can either execute some functions sequentially with *sequentialExecute* or use ready functions to load scripts or stylesheets or other files (flash for example) one after another.

Most useful functions are *withScripts* and *withStyles*

Use cases are 

withScripts('/js/some-script.js', '/js/some-other-script.js', function(){
  alert('all scripts loaded');
});

withStyles('/css/some-style.css', '/js/some-other-style.css', function(){
  alert('all css files are loaded and appended to head');
});
